        Hemmed by the Arabian Sea in the west, Western Ghats in the east, Nethravathi River in the south and Kulur River in the North, Mangalore

        Mangalore lies 353km from the capital city of Karnataka- Bangalore. The urban agglomeration of Mangalore stretches over more than 30 kilometres from Ullal in the South to Surathkal in the North. The city stretches to Vamanjoor, Deralakatte, Padil, and Bajpe in the east.
        
        The city is well connected by road, rail and air. Mangalore International Airport connects major cities in India and the Middle East.
        
        Mangalore developed in earlier times as a harbour in the Arabian Sea and then rose to become a major port in India. The New Mangalore Port is an all-weather port located at Panambur in Mangalore.
        
        It is the only major port in the state of Karnataka with the deepest harbour on the west coast. It is a point of departure for maritime traffic along the Malabar Coast.
        
        The port accounts for about 75% exports of major commodities like coffee and cashew in India.</p><hr>
